#SafePhish
SafePhish is a product and service being developed to provide small to medium businesses with a way of testing their employees' phishing scam awareness. It involves a Web Interface that clients can use to view test results and start new tests. It also has it's own Outlook Addin for reporting potential phishing scams for review.
